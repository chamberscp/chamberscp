- 👋 Hi, I’m @chamberscp.  I am 22 year United States Marine.  I am preparing for a career in IT after my end of service obligations next year.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things IT, but plan to focus my learning efforts on becoming an AWS Solutions Architect or DevOps engineer.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cloud basics, AWS Architect path, and bash commands and plan to learn Python and certify in all three areas.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything.  I have no planned projects yet, as I just started learning on AWS Skillbuilder, and have no practical application. 
- 📫 You can reach me at christopher.p.chamebrs@gmail.com.
